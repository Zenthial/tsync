# tsync
A tool for actively syncing files between your local host and a remote host. 
Inspired by the need to stop entering credentials when transfering files on keyless auth servers.
Influenced by [rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo).

Designed to sync relatively small directories. Anything larger than a few dozen files should consider alternative methods.

## Use Cases
- Transfering a single binary to a test server
- Transfering a source directory of python files
